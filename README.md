# Home-Safety-and-Anti-Theft-System
A hardware project using Proteus 

Our system will perform following action:

If there is a gas leakage in the house, the Gas Sensor will pick it up, an alarm will be set; GSM module will send a message to the nearby fire-station along with
GPS location. If there is a fire-breakout in the house, the temperature sensor will detect it, an alarm will be set; GSM module will send a message to the nearby
fire-station along with GPS location. If a home invader or a thief enters a house,PIR sensor will detect his movement, an alarm will be set; GSM module will send
a message to the nearby police-station along with GPS location.
